<h1>Top 5 Python IDEs for developers</h1>

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It's a coding tool which allows you to write, test and debug your code in an easier way, as they typically offer code completion or code insight by highlighting, resource management, debugging tools,... And even though the IDE is a strictly defined concept, it's starting to be redefined as other tools such as notebooks start gaining more and more features that traditionally belong to IDEs. For example, debugging your code is also possible in Jupyter Notebook. 

You can probably most clearly see this evolution in the results of the <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2016#technology-development-environments'>Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a> below, which also includes these new tools, next to the traditional IDEs that you might already know; They all fall under the section "development environment". 

Because of all the features that IDEs have to offer, they are extremely useful for development: they make your coding more comfortable and this is no different for data science. However, given the fact that there aren't only the traditional IDEs to consider, but also new tools, such as notebooks, you might be wondering which IDE to use when you're just starting out with data science. 

<h2>IDE vs Text Editors</h2>
<img src='so-poll.jpg'></img>

The truth is that you can code in almost any software, from prompt command to Windows notepad, but you may also want a proper programming environment which combines coding facility with a debugging environment. So why would or do you choose a traditional IDE instead of, for example, a notepad? The answer would be practicality. For instance, imagine that you are coding in any text editor like Windows notepad. When your code is ready, you'll need to run it. You can't execute your program in a text editor like this, so you must use a prompt command to do it. Rather than use two different programs, wouldn't better have it all in just one place? That's what an IDE is ready for.

But, take a closer look at the image above. Notepad++, which is a text editor in its essence, is one of the tools most used by Stack Overflow community. 

Isn't that weird?

Well, many text editors can be used as an IDE if you make use of plugins: when you're working with Notepad++, for example, you can use these plugins such as the <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/DBGP%20Plugin/'>DBGP for Notepad++</a> to install a debugger in the application, allowing you to run and analyze your code directly in your favorite text editor. 

And this immediately explains why text editors can be so popular: they not only offer you the blank slate, but they also give you the option to add features that you might need. This stands in clear contrast with IDEs such as Visual Studio, Spyder, and Rodeo, where these features are built in and you don't need to install anything else to start developing, but where the learning curve might be a little bit steeper for users.

<h2>The Top 5 IDEs For Data Science With Python</h2>

Creating a list with just five IDEs to do data science with Python is a hard task: you might not only want to consider the possible learning curve, price or built-in/downloadable features, but you also might want to take into account the possibility to visualize and report on your results, or how easy a certain IDE makes it for you to collaborate with others. 

You'll see that your choice will balance all of these things and that the 'best' IDE for you will be the one which makes your life easier and your work more comfortable. 

That's why it's best to see this list as a guide of software to test before you pick your favorite.

<h2>Spyder</h2>
<img src='spyder.png' alt='Spyder interface'></img>

If you have the Anaconda distribution installed on your computer, you probably already know Spyder. It's an open source cross-platform IDE for data science. If you have never worked with an IDE, Spyder could perfectly be your first approach. It integrates the essentials libraries for data science, such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and IPython, besides that, it can be extended with plugins.

Different of most of IDEs around the web, Spyder was built specifically for data science. It may not be as charming as another IDEs such as Visual Studio or Atom, but give it a try! The learning curve is so smooth that you will master it in a blink of an eye. If you are a beginner, you'll like to use features like the online help, which allows you search for specific information about libraries.

Spyder contains features like a text editor with syntax highlighting, code completion and variable exploring, which you can edit its values using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Spyder is free and it's available for Windows, MacOS and major Linux distributions, like Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. You can install Spyder by <a href='https://www.continuum.io/downloads'>downloading Anaconda on Continuum's website</a>.

<h2>PyCharm</h2>
<img src='pycharm.png' alt='PyCharm interface'></img>

PyCharm is an IDE made by the folks at JetBrain, a team responsible for one of the most famous Java IDE, the IntelliJ IDEA. This tool could be perfect for those who already have experience using another JetBrain's IDE, due to the fact that the interface and features be similar.

Just like other IDEs, PyCharm has interesting features such as a code editor, errors highlighting, a powerful debugger with a graphical interface, besides of Git integration, SVN, and Mercurial. 

Talking about integration, if you like IPython or Anaconda distribution, it would be nice for you to know that PyCharm integrates its tools and libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib, allowing you work with array viewers and interactive plots.

In addition to Python, PyCharm provides support for JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Angular JS, Node.js, and so on, what makes it a good option for web development. Available for free on Windows, Linux and Mac, you can expand PyCharm's features by mean of plugins. You can also customize your IDE, choosing between different themes, color schemes, and key-binding.

<h2>Rodeo</h2>
<img src='rodeo-tutorials.gif' width='750px'></img>

This IDE, clearly distinguishable from the logo with the orange hat, is one of the best Python IDEs for data science. That's because it was built specifically for data analysis. It's pretty similar to RStudio, which is by far the most popular IDE for the R language, not just because of its appearance, but also for its features. 

For instance, when you first open up Rodeo, the IDE's window is divided into four groups: text editor, console, environment for variable visualization and plot/libraries/files, just like RStudio. You can clearly see this in the above image.

The division of the windows isn't a bad thing. On the contrary, if you are an R user and you are migrating to Python, Rodeo surely could be your initial approach. It is also great for newbies, thanks to its helper material such as cheat sheets and built-in tutorials. The main advantage of this IDE is its customization. You can easily see and explore what you are creating, either by inspecting variable's values and interacting with plots and data frames. For free, Rodeo is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac. You can download it on <a href='https://www.yhat.com/products/rodeo'>Yhat official website</a>.

<h2>Atom</h2>
<img src='atom.jpg'></img>

An open source IDE developed by Github. That sounds great, right? 

That's exactly what Atom is. 

Although it's available for many popular programming languages such as Ruby on Rails, PHP, Java and so on, Atom has interesting features that create a good experience for Python developers. One of the best advantages of Atom is its community, chiefly due to the constants enhancements and plugins that they develop in order to customize your IDE and improve your workflow.

For instance, One of this plugins - called "Packages" - is the <a href='https://atom.io/packages/data-atom'>Data Atom</a>, which allows you to write and execute SQL queries. It supports PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL. Besides that, you can also visualize your results on Atom, without open any other window. 

As you already expected, Atom's integration with git is awesome. And, as other IDEs, it allows you to use multiples panes, themes, and colors, managing multiples projects. 

Do you want to know one of the downsides? Atom might have a weak performance on older CPUs. 

Based in Electron - also known as Atom Shell, a cross-platform desktop applications framework by using Chromium -, Atom is available for free for Windows, OS X, and Linux. <a href='https://atom.io/'>You can download it clicking here</a>! 

<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<img src='jupyter-notebook.png'></img>



Jupyter Notebook was born out of IPython in 2014. It is a web application based on server-client structure and it allows you to create and manipulate notebook documents - or just "notebooks". Jupyter Notebook doesn't work just as an IDE, but also as a presentation tool. The notebook is divided into cells, independent blocks of code that support programming languages like Julia, Python, R and many others. In addition to that, Jupyter Notebook supports markdowns, allowing you to add HTML components from images to videos.

Thanks to Jupyter, you can easily see and edit your code in order to create compelling presentations. For instance, you can use data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn and show your graphs in the same document where your code is. 

Besides that, you can export your final work to PDF and HTML files, or you can just export it as a .py file. In addition, you can also create blogs and presentations from your notebooks. <!-- go a little bit further into the output options ---> 

Jupyter Notebook is easy to install and easier to use. If you want to know everything about Jupyter and its details, <a href='https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook'>check it out this tutorial that will guide you through this awesome data science tool</a>.

<h2>Honorable mentions</h2>

What's the best IDE for you? 

The answer is simple: that one which makes your life easier and your work more comfortable. 

The purpose of this list is to give you good references to start off. You can test each one and give your considerations about what it's good and bad at. In addition to that, you can try some alternatives that probably might give you an even better score.

<img src='nteract.jpg'></img>

For instance, <a href='https://nteract.io/'>nteract.io</a> could be a good alternative. nteract is a desktop application that allows you to create notebooks just like Jupyter Notebook, however, Instead of setting a server like in Jupyter, you download and execute an application that provides you all the tools to create beautiful documents with code and markdown. It's available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, besides of support ipynb files - IPython notebooks.

<img src='visual-studio-code.gif'></img>

Another alternative could be the Visual Studio Code. It's a text editor developed by Microsoft, but which can also be used as an IDE. One good thing about Visual Studio is it Git integration. Like Atom, you can commit, sync and create branches in your repositories easily with this application. Visual Studio contains a feature called IntelliSense, which provides code completions based on variable types, functions and imported modules. It also provides syntax highlighting and autocomplete function.

<img src='thonny.png'></img>

To finish our list, we need to make mention of Thonny: an IDE for learning and teaching programming. It's a software developed in University of Tartu, which you can <a href='https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny/downloads/'>download for free on Bitbucket</a> for Windows, Linux, and Mac. Among its features, Thonny supports code completion and highlight syntax errors, but it also provides a simple debugger, which you can run your program step-by-step. While editing a function, a new window is opened with local variables and the code being shown separately of your main code. The purpose of Thonny is give you a good understanding about how Python works under the hood.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

IDEs surely can help you to improve your workflow and make your results profitable. You can write, execute and debug your code easily, aside from customizing windows and colors. Instead of a traditional IDE, you can also try a text editor like Notepad++, but keep in mind that you'll need to expand it by using plugins (such as PyNPP) if you want to execute your code.
